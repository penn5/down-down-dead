# Down Down Dead game

HOW TO PLAY

The red square follows the mouse. Move the red dot to intersect the white dots. The green dot will go to the red dot when it intersects the white dot. Keep the green dot as high as you can as it will drop on its own if you do nothing.
Make the green avoid the white dots, even though the red needs to hit it.

Hope you enjoy the game!
